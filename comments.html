                            <p>I wanted to include a design that made use of whitespace and felt minimalistic. This means the user will not get overwhelmed with stuff when they enter the webpage.</p>
                            <p>I then used consitent styling across all pages to introduce familiarity of pages to the user. This is partnered with a consistent navigation element that sits at the top of every single page.</p>
                            <p>The aim of using this styling is to allow the users to have a calm and relaxing experience while also being able to absorb information displayed on the page.</p>

                            <p>The colours I wanted to include in the website are neutral. This includes: whites, blacks and greys. I would then use orange as an accent colour.</p>
                        </div>

                    <td>
                        <div class="container">
                            <p>The first class I would use is the ".container" class. This allowed me to have an even margin on either side of the page, achieving a clean design.</p>
                            <p>For spacing I would use multiple different "wrapper" classes. This allowed me to achieve the spacing I wanted around certain parts of the website.</p>
                            <p>The navigation elements that are consistent on each page are styled with ".navbar" classes which allows it to easily be transferred to each page.</p>
                            <p>I also used the ".cards" class to style divs with content in them. These are interactive with hover and allow information to be respresented in a clean manner.</p>

                        <div class="container">
                            <p>On each page is a header text at the top. On this element is a class called blnking. This triggers a css animation to run which changes the opacity of the element every 3 seconds</p>

                        <div class="container">
                            <p>I used an ID on the wrapper in the first page. This was to set the spacing on one div that would be used on only that page.</p>

                            <p>For people with eye disabilities especially, I wanted to keep the colours consistent. This allows the user to have a more relaxing experience on the website.</p>
                            <p>For people with reading disorders. I kept the font-family exactly the same on all pages, the size of body text is consistent across all pages and I tried to keep all the text short and consice for readbility purposes.</p>
