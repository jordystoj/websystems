                        <p> For my year 11 major project I made a Blood Alcohol Calculator Web App. It used nodejs and meteor on the backend, Mongodb for the database and blaze as the templating for the frontend. This was my first major web development task.</p>
                        <p> The user would access a database of drinks and allow them to search for what they had been drinking and add the amount they have drank to their list. After selecting all the drinks, the user would input their body mass, height and gender and the website would respond with their blood alchol content (BAC). </p>

                        <p> For my year 12 major project I made a centralised system to collect and connect statistics of all amateur football leagues in Australia. It used nodejs and express on the backend, Mongodb for the database and pug as the templating for the frontend. As this was my second major web development project I wanted to challenge myself by building something that has potential of becoming a real service.</p>
                        <p> The users would first login into the platform. Once logged in, they are able to check tables, fixtures, players, clubs and teams. It would also have the ability to provide live scores to fixtures and provide player profiles with statistics for people to view.</p>

                        <p> Throttle Roll is a motorcycle event held every year in Sydney. They publish articles, organise events and allow the motorcycle community to connect. I helped build their website. The website is built using Wordpress, MySQL and PHP. </p>
